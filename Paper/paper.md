# Summary
Plagiarism, from an academic perspective, is defined as an act of presenting other people’s ideas, statements or works as their own [@anderson2011problem]. It is always a concern in universities and other academic institutions as this is quite common among students while submitting any assignments or reports. Teachers face difficulties in marking students’ assignments with a higher degree of judgment and waste their valuable time for plagiarism detection. In addition to that plagiarism has a serious effect on the learning objectives and creative thinkings of students. This software focuses on building an effective, simple and robust tool for plagiarism detection on text-based electronic assignments to minimize this issue and help teachers in conducting the proper evaluation of assignments and reports. Though text retrieval research has yielded some mature systems that are successful to detect copied or moderately altered text in an input document, those are well-suited to detect plagiarism of copy-paste type only (Debora Weber-Wulff. 2014). Researchers have proposed numerous approaches to improve the text-similarity assessment methods by adopting methods like paraphrasing, sentence matching or keyword matching (K. Vani and Deepa Gupta. 2016). Some commercially existing software such as have implemented those approaches and established those as an effective solution to detect plagiarism. A list of that software can be found in K. Vani and Deepa Gupta. 2016. However, none of those are freely available as well as they do not fulfill the actual need of academic faculties and instructors. To fulfill the aforementioned issues, AcPgChecker focuses on providing an effective tool for academic faculties and instructors to detect plagiarism in text-based electronic assignments. 


# Summary

``SpiceyPy`` is an open-source, MIT licensed Python package that provides a ``pythonic`` interface to nearly all of the C SPICE toolkit N66. 
``SpiceyPy`` was developed in Python using the ``ctypes`` module of the CPython standard library to wrap the underlying C SPICE shared library. 
Developing ``SpiceyPy`` in Python enabled the SpiceyPy API to expose simplified and more ``pythonic`` interactions with the underlying C API for SPICE.
``SpiceyPy`` relies on the NumPy library for numeric arrays and tight integration with the SciPy stack.

``SpiceyPy`` is extensively tested using a combination of unit and integration tests, which run using continuous integration services. 
The tests also serve as code examples translated from the NAIF documentation. 
Continuous deployment updates documentation and deploys artifacts of releases to PyPI and the conda-forge. 
Every SPICE function wrapper in SpiceyPy contains docstrings that provide short descriptions of the function duplicated from the SPICE
 documentation. 
Docstrings in SpiceyPy also contain links to the corresponding CSPICE documentation page hosted by the NAIF to provide additional details
 regarding the function. 

``SpiceyPy`` enables scientists to utilize the full functionality of SPICE within Python and the ecosystem of visualization and
 scientific packages available. 
``SpiceyPy`` has been utilized in peer-reviewed research [@behar:2016; @behar:2017; @porter:2018; @zangari:2018; @attree:2019], masters
 and doctoral theses [@hackett:2019; @albin:2019], spacecraft mission operations, as a dependency in other Python libraries [@heliopy:2019
 ], and for a variety of other projects [@wilson:2016; @wilson_times:2017; @costa:2018].
